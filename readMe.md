# Car Inventory System

## Objective

In this exercise, you will complete the implementation of a basic **Car Inventory System**. The system should manage a collection of cars, allowing you to add, retrieve, sell, update, and search cars using various attributes.

This challenge focuses on your ability to use **collections** effectively (particularly `HashMap` and `List`), apply **OOP principles**, and structure data in a way that supports efficient queries and updates.
